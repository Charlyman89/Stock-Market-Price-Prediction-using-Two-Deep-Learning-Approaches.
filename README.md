# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction-using-Two-Deep-Learning-Approaches.
We designed two deep learning methods for predicting stock market prices, namely; 1D-CNN and LSTM. We built a flexible and robust architecture that will reduce the mean sum of squares between the predicted and actual values of the stock prices.
